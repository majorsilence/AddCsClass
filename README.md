# AddCsClass
Add a new c# file to a c# project file from commandline.

There is probably a much better way to do this and I would be grateful if someone pointed it out.  Mabye [edge](https://github.com/tjanczuk/edge) but that seems like a lot for just this one requirement.

# Example

```bash
AddCsClass.exe "path to project file.csproj" "path to new .cs file"
```
